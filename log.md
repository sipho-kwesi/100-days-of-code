# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: 12th January 2020 

Today's Progress: I worked on functionality on the rock-paper-scissors application. 

Thoughts: I found the exercise quite fun, and challenging but extremely rewarding once I figured out the logic. I learned JavaScript Fundamental syntax and constructs such as variables, functions, and operators.

Day 1: 14th January 2020

Today's Progress: I continued working on the functionality of the rock-paper-scissors application. I also read some articles about functions and started a command line short course. I read an article about the feynman technique.

Thoughts: Functions are fascinating especially the ability to use callbacks. I still don't understand it fully but my friday reviews using the feynman technique should be produce satisfactory results.

Today's Progress: I built a basic web-page based on a youtube clone.

Thoughts: utilising powerful tools like css grid and flexbox to automate the responsive layout was really efficient.
