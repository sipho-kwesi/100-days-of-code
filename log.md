# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: 12th January 2020 

Today's Progress: I worked on functionality on the rock-paper-scissors application. 

Thoughts: I found the exercise quite fun, and challenging but extremely rewarding once I figured out the logic. I learned JavaScript Fundamental syntax and constructs such as variables, functions, and operators.
